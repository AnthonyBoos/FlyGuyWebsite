        Game Station started off as a small company based in San Diego, California. Gamestation was formed In March, 2010, by four programmers hoping to create a unique gaming experiance. The board of directors includes: Anthony Boos, Aria Cusenza, Ethan Bishop,and Zeb Losinger. Since the creation of our gaming company we have created a variety of flash games and the majority of them are free. However, we do charge a small fee for our special edition and limited edition flash games.</p>
